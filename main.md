# Arceus (London) Simplified Manual
Use **Arceus** to have Pokémon alerts delivered to your Discord DMs, according to your customised settings.

### To start
Post the command `!alert` in the #bot-commands channel in the PoGoLondon Discord. This will open a DM channel with Arceus. In this DM channel, you will both post some of the commands listed below and receive the Pokémon alerts.

### Overview
There are two parts: your **location**, and your **filters** – i.e. Pokémon names/groups, (minimum) IV/CP/levels, and distances. If a Pokémon spawns matching one of your filters, *within the specified distance of your location*, you will receive the alert! Here is a page for each, explaining how to set it up.
