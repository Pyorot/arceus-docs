## Location
You can store a list of locations to switch between (**add** and **remove**), but will have only one active location at a time (chosen by **set**ting). You can switch your active location as you wish, but you must type the command; there is no tracking.

### 1. Viewing Locations
```
!location show
```
Shows a list of your saved locations, and shows which is active. It's the go-to to see what's going on with locations.

---

### 2. Adding/Removing Locations
```
!location add name=<name> coord=<coords>
!location add name=needle coord=51.5085,-0.1204
```
Adds a new location. **Note the following:**
* `<name>` should be alphanumeric (perhaps with underscores); spaces won't be accepted.
* The command is `coord`, not `coords`!
* `<coords>` should be in decimal notation only (`51.xxx..,0.xxx..`, perhaps with minuses).
* No spaces around the comma between coords, nor either side of any of the `=` in the command.
* Even if you only add one location, it doesn't automatically become active (see **ยง3. Setting/Unsetting Locations** below).

```
!location remove <name>
!location remove needle
```
Removes a location by its name as stored at `!location show`.
```
!location remove all
```
Removes all stored locations; start afresh!

---

### 3. Setting/Unsetting Locations
```
!location set needle
```
Sets a location to active by its name as stored at `!location show`. All other locations become inactive.
```
!location mute
```
Sets all locations to inactive.
